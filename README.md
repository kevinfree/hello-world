# hello-world
What's up. I'm learning how to use git hub hopefully.

I am a Junior at Mizzou studying computer science.
I am trying to learn GitHub for use in CS 4320 Software Engineering 1.
I would like to be more affluent in programming and software engineering, and this seems like a good step.

If at some point, my account seems significantly competant and contains lots of cool
code and stuff, just know that today, I feel wholly unprepared to do anything like that.

Cool
